# Getting Started
1. Ensure that you have node + npm installed 
2. Run `npm i` in this directory and in `src/client` and `src/autocomplete`
3. In this directory, run `npm start`, it should start up concurrently. For some reason while on WSL2, I'm unable to have the client app start on localhost:3000. If you run into this issue, try launching the network path provided by react
